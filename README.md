# Traverse
## Dynamic Travel Journal
Traverse is a digital scrapbook that allows you to easily and beautifully document your travels with just a few clicks of a button. Relive your experiences. Share trip recommendations with your friends. And segment your journey chronologically, via tags, or by Google map overview.

## Technologies
Traverse is built using decoupled architecture with angular.js, node.js and express.js on the frontend and Rails-API on the backend. In addition, we used JWT for authentication, as well as Facebook and Instagram OAuth to pull in photos from your trips. We leveraged the Yelp API to keep track of places you visited and the Google Maps API to render a trip overview display of your trip.
